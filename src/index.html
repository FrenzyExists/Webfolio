        <h3><img class="pixel-ruby" alt="ruby" src="images/ruby.png">Who am I</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
            My name is Angel Garcia (yeah I'm latin, deal with it), I have 20 years old and I started my journey to web development two days before I 
            wrote this (Feb 6, 2020). I kinda have some background on programming, and I wanted to add web development to my toolbelt by making this 
            website. Currently I'm pursuing my goal of mastering front-end web development, as well as being a professional C#, Python and Java prorgrammer.

            Here on my webfolio you'll find my projects I've been working on my free time or that I did during university (which of course I remake because 
            the originals were terrible). I also share my art (pixel art), on which I often some inspiration of pro artits azimuth and one of my three favorite 
            games: Hyper Light Drifter. I'm also thinking on making a feedback box where, as the name implies anyone seeing this webpage can give me some helpul 
            feedback (or roast me to death). This webfolio is also some kind of blog, but for people with no sense of time. Enter Random, where I write either 
            articles about tech, tutorials about a technology I'm currently learning, or simply some random thing that happened to me or my progress on 
            programming or whatever I dunno. You got some black coffee? Anyway don't expect much order over here, nor coerence. I'm tired and sleepy, I should 
            go to bed. Long time I don't read some good manga, should check em. Ok there goes the coerence. What the heck is that noise? Oh, its the dogs fighting 
            again. Sometimes the neighbors horse also does noise at this time, its been pretty quiet for the last 4 or 5 days. Ok I'm out

        <!-- Probably webdevs seeing this are arching their fingers wondering how they can murder me after watching my source code :V -->
        <p class="ps">So, yeah, I kinda make this page in like about a week, which I guess is a lot of time, but I wanna point out I made this on my spare time while studying on college. Also, I'm a surveying engineering students... deal with it</p>

<!--
    TODO

    * Build a table-like list that shows my skills (ie. Python, skill level: intermediate, framework knowledge: none, experience: 1 year (currently inactive))
      The skills should be something like "my skills" and if you click it it will cascade down

    * Build a menu bar that goes with the page as the user scrolls (ie. [Home, My Projects, Random Stuff, My Art ])

    * Learn how to make a webserver in the first place

    * Create the My Projects page (currently a blank page or so)

    * make a search bar or something like that

    * make a contact me section below each damn page even tho I have no facebook, twitter, instagram or channel.

    * (OPTIONAL) make a tumblr account cuz I also gonna have to learn graphic design

    PS since I am doing this alone I kinda have to learn all the roles a team would do on a website project or something like that. Also, this is on my spare time so, yeah, going pretty slow

    * work on a article because I should also learn and get a habit of making blogs or whatever

    *upload this pastapiece to github *USING EXCLUSIVELY THE TERMINAL YOU BAKA*

    * update the home.css thing

    *update the readme.md for watever reason

    * Hey I made galaga on three different programming languages...! I hate myself!
