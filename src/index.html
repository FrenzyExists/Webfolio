        <h3>Who am I</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Hi! I'm Frenzy, but my real name is Angel Garcia. I'm a poor third year surveying engineering student who knows computer stuff. I have 20 years 
            old and I started my journey to web development two days before I 
            wrote this (Feb 6, 2020). I kinda have some background on programming, and I wanted to add web development to my toolbelt by making this 
            website. Currently I'm pursuing my goal of mastering front-end web development, as well as being a professional C#, Python and Java prorgrammer. 
        </p>

        <hr style="border-top: 0; margin: 1rem;">

        <p class="paragraph">I made this website during the spring semester while on university, originally as part of one of the freecodecamp project on my derpy journey to 
            learn frontend web development. I try to make things work. There are many goals I have that are not complete, being a fullstack developer on a 
            part-time is one of them. To achieve that goal, I set my self to-do list (yes, I have an addiction for to-do lists, shut up) that will help me 
            get some sense of direction. Sometimes, companies want a specific set of skills, and a good engineer must be prepared for the worst. That's why 
            I also want to learn embeded systems before entering to the electronics I course the university where I study offers. So, yeah, surveying is kinda 
            fun, but is not my type. Programming and fidling with circuits is my passion, wether I struggle in it or not. This also requires a long to-do list 
            in order to achieve it. There's also the need for a schedule (which of course I constantly break). Too much information for my small brain to handle. 
            And for my final goal, graduate from university with a bachelor on Computer Engineering, and work on a company that allows me to drink infinite amounts
             of coffee (hopefully Microsoft).</p>

        <h3 style="font-size:14px">Edit:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">I thought I would't return and fix the mess I made now that I know a bit more html and css. I've ben hours between free time, 
            and now a bit more thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been trying to fix issues with the web regarding the layout when the screen is resized. 
            It still has it bugs, but I want to keep this intact from now on, as a checkpoint during my journey in Web Development, I've made other stuff too, 
            check them out on the project section!</p>

        <h3>What is this Website</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Here on my webfolio you'll find my projects I've been working on my free time or that I did during university (which of course I remake because 
            the originals were terrible). I also share my art (pixel art), on which I often some inspiration of pro artits azimuth and one of my three favorite 
            games: Hyper Light Drifter. I'm also thinking on making a feedback box where, as the name implies anyone seeing this webpage can give me some helpul 
            feedback (or roast me to death). This webfolio is also some kind of blog, but for people with no sense of time. In Blog you'll find either 
            articles about tech, tutorials about a technology I'm currently learning, or simply some random thing that happened to me or my progress on 
            programming or whatever I dunno. You got some black coffee? Anyway don't expect much order over here, nor coerence. I'm tired and sleepy, I should 
            go to bed. Long time I don't read some good manga, should check em. Ok there goes the coerence. What the heck is that noise? Oh, its the dogs fighting 
            again. Sometimes the neighbors horse also does noise at this time, its been pretty quiet for the last 4 or 5 days. Ok Imma head out.
        </p>

        <!-- Probably webdevs seeing this are arching their fingers wondering how they can murder me after watching my source code :V -->
        <blockquote>So, yeah, I kinda make this page in like about 2 week, which I guess is a lot of time, but I wanna point out I made this on my spare time while studying on college. Also, I'm a surveying engineering student... deal with it</blockquote>
        
        <h3 style="font-size:14px">Edit:</h3>
        <blockquote>Many things happened before this final update. During the time of this edit, I'm requesting a change of concentration to Computer Enginering, aka an Electrical Engineer that can program. This is my final update on what is my very first web portfolio... (May 3, 2020).</blockquote>

<!--

    I am going to leave this old todo list anyway, sometimes I can't finish certain tasks, and sometimes, I tend to go back and visit the past...

    TODO

    * Build a table-like list that shows my skills (ie. Python, skill level: intermediate, framework knowledge: none, experience: 1 year (currently inactive))
      The skills should be something like "my skills" and if you click it it will cascade down

    * Build a menu bar that goes with the page as the user scrolls (ie. [Home, My Projects, Random Stuff, My Art ])

    * Learn how to make a webserver in the first place

    * Create the My Projects page (currently a blank page or so)

    * make a search bar or something like that

    * make a contact me section below each damn page even tho I have no facebook, twitter, instagram or channel.

    * (OPTIONAL) make a tumblr account cuz I also gonna have to learn graphic design

    PS since I am doing this alone I kinda have to learn all the roles a team would do on a website project or something like that. Also, this is on my spare time so, yeah, going pretty slow

    * work on a article because I should also learn and get a habit of making blogs or whatever

    *upload this pastapiece to github *USING EXCLUSIVELY THE TERMINAL YOU BAKA*

    * update the home.css thing

    *update the readme.md for watever reason

    * Hey I made galaga on three different programming languages...! I hate myself!
