        <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
        <p>This week I am very excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In this technique, you submerge 
            the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to target the temperature 
            you want the food to be cooked to.</p>
