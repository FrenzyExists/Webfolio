<!--
    The owners of the Black Goose Bistro have decided to start a
    blog to share recipes and announcements. In the exercises in this
    chapter, we’ll assist them with content markup.
    Below you will find the raw text of a recipe. It’s up to you to
    decide which element is the best semantic match for each chunk
    of content. You’ll use paragraphs, headings, lists, and at least one
    special content element.
    You can write the tags right on this page. Or, if you want to
    use a text editor and see the results in a browser, this text file is
    available online at www.learningwebdesign.com/4e/materials.
    The resulting code appears in Appendix A.

        <h2>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h2>    

        <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it’s always a big hit at parties. Some random dad recommends:</p>

        <blockquote>
            “Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature
            before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm.”
        </blockquote>
