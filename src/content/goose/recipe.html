    The owners of the Black Goose Bistro have decided to start a
blog to share recipes and announcements. In the exercises in this
chapter, we’ll assist them with content markup.
Below you will find the raw text of a recipe. It’s up to you to
decide which element is the best semantic match for each chunk
of content. You’ll use paragraphs, headings, lists, and at least one
special content element.
You can write the tags right on this page. Or, if you want to
use a text editor and see the results in a browser, this text file is
available online at www.learningwebdesign.com/4e/materials.
The resulting code appears in Appendix A.

Tapenade (Olive Spread)
This is a really simple dish to prepare and it’s always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:
“Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature
before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm.”
Ingredients
1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes
2 large garlic cloves
2/3 c. kalamata olives
1 t. capers
Instructions
Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possible.
Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain some
texture.
Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).
